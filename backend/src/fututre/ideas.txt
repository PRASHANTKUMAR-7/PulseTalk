What I am Basically Building

A Chat + Video Calling app (like WhatsApp/Signal).

With real-time AI translation:

For text â†’ auto-translated on delivery.

For video calls â†’ add AI subtitles or even voice translation (speech-to-speech) in future.

Feasibility (Current Tech)

Text Translation: Easy with APIs like Google Translate API, DeepL, or OpenAI GPT models.

Voice/Video Translation: More advanced, but doable with Whisper (speech-to-text) + translation model + text-to-speech.

You can start with text chat only (MVP), then scale to voice/video.

ðŸ”¹ 1. Using AI Agents

An AI agent is basically an intelligent component that can decide how to process input.

In your case, an agent could:

Detect the language of the incoming message.

Choose the right translation model (e.g., Hindi â†” Korean).

Pass it to a translator (Google Translate API, Hugging Face model, or OpenAI).

Return the translated text in real-time to the chat.

ðŸ‘‰ So yes, you could design a translation agent that works inside PulseTalk to handle all this automatically.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Using Hugging Face

Hugging Face has translation models like MarianMT, M2M100, and NLLB (No Language Left Behind).

These models can translate between 100+ languages without needing English as a pivot.

You could host them:

On Hugging Face Inference API (easy but paid).

On your own backend using Transformers library (cheaper, but you need GPU).

ðŸ‘‰ Hugging Face is perfect if you want custom control and donâ€™t want to rely only on Google Translate.

ðŸ”¹ 3. Hybrid Approach (Best Practical Path)

MVP (basic chat): Use Google Translate API / DeepL API â†’ quick, reliable, cheap.

Advanced version: Switch to Hugging Face models for more control and possibly offline/self-hosted translation.

Add AI Agent layer later â†’ to handle language detection, routing, caching, and maybe even personalized tone adaptation (formal/informal translation).
